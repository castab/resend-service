# ADR-0001: Per-conversation Reply-To routing tokens

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Applies to:** inbound email → conversation association (threading)

## TL;DR

Outbound conversation emails are sent with a Reply-To address that looks like a
mailbox with a random key in it:

```
bookings+c_cb208a4f1e5e46c39f50d1f84d8b5867@mail-dev.fionasicecream.com
```

That `+c_<32 hex>` suffix is **not a mailbox** — it is a per-conversation *routing
token* carried by [plus-addressing (subaddressing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Subaddressing).
It exists as a **fallback** so we can still attach an inbound reply to the correct
conversation when standard RFC 5322 header threading fails. We keep it because the
alternative that would remove it — assigning our own RFC `Message-ID` — **does not
work with Resend**, as proven by a live test (see [Rejected alternative](#rejected-alternative-self-assigned-message-id)).

## Context

This service threads a conversation between the business and a single external
participant (the customer). When an inbound email arrives via the Resend webhook, we
must decide **which existing conversation it belongs to**, or start a new one.

We resolve that with a precedence chain in
[`projectInboundEmail`](../src/lib/email/conversations.ts):

1. **RFC header threading (primary).** Match the inbound `In-Reply-To` / `References`
   ancestry against the `internetMessageId` of messages we have already stored,
   scoped to the same participant address, preferring a conversation that is already
   assigned to a topic.
2. **Waiting-children recovery.** Handle the race where a reply arrives before we have
   learned our own outbound `Message-ID` (see below).
3. **Routing token (fallback).** If nothing above matched, look up the conversation by
   the `+c_<token>` value parsed out of the inbound `To` / `received_for` addresses —
   but only if it resolves to exactly one conversation **and** the participant address
   matches (a guard so a leaked/guessed token cannot cross-link another sender).
4. **New conversation.** Otherwise create one, keyed on normalized subject + sender.

The routing token is deliberately the **third** choice, not the first. Header threading
is the primary mechanism and matches Resend's own recommendation.

### Why header threading is not sufficient on its own

Reliable header threading requires that, when a customer replies, their mail client's
`In-Reply-To` points at the `Message-ID` of a message **we sent and recorded**. Two
things break that:

- **Some clients strip or mangle** `In-Reply-To` / `References`.
- **We do not know our outbound `Message-ID` at send time.** Resend's send API returns
  only its own internal `id`, not the RFC `Message-ID`. We learn the real `Message-ID`
  only *after* the fact by calling `getSent()` and back-filling it — the "hydration"
  logic in [`conversation-service.ts`](../src/lib/conversation-service.ts) and
  [`conversations.ts`](../src/lib/email/conversations.ts). A reply can arrive during
  that window, referencing a `Message-ID` we have not stored yet.

The routing token is immune to both: it is chosen by us, embedded in the address the
customer replies *to*, and echoed back verbatim by every mail client regardless of how
they treat threading headers.

## Decision

Keep a per-conversation routing token, embedded via plus-addressing in the outbound
Reply-To, as a fallback matcher behind RFC header threading.

### How it works

- **Generation:** a UUID per conversation, stored as
  `EmailConversation.routingToken` (see [`prisma/schema.prisma`](../prisma/schema.prisma)),
  defaulting to `gen_random_uuid()`.
- **Encoding:** [`buildConversationReplyTo`](../src/lib/email/routing.ts) renders it as
  `<local>+c_<32 hex>@<domain>` (UUID lowercased, dashes stripped). The `c_` tag prefix
  namespaces it; the base mailbox is validated so the generated local-part stays within
  RFC length limits.
- **Parsing:** [`extractRoutingTokens`](../src/lib/email/routing.ts) pulls the token
  back out of inbound recipient addresses, re-inserts the dashes, and matches it against
  `routingToken`.
- **Requirement:** the receiving domain must accept plus-addressed mail to the base
  mailbox (Resend inbound does).

## Rejected alternative: self-assigned Message-ID

The obvious way to delete both the routing token *and* the Message-ID hydration would be
to **generate our own RFC `Message-ID` at send time** (`<uuid@our-domain>`), store it
immediately, and set it via the `headers` param. Then the outbound `Message-ID` would be
known instantly, header threading would be fully reliable, and the token would be
redundant.

**This does not work with Resend.** Resend sends through Amazon SES, and SES **overwrites
the `Message-ID`**. Verified with a live test on 2026-07-24:

- Sent from `booking@mail-dev.fionasicecream.com` with
  `headers: { "Message-ID": "<verify-840afca1-...@mail-dev.fionasicecream.com>" }`.
- The Resend API (`get-email`) reported the sent `message_id` as
  `<0100019f91f4e4c6-...@email.amazonses.com>` — an SES value, **not ours**.
- The customer's Gmail reply carried:

  ```
  In-Reply-To: <0100019f91f4e4c6-...@email.amazonses.com>
  References:  <0100019f91f4e4c6-...@email.amazonses.com>
  ```

  i.e. it referenced the **SES-assigned** id, not the one we set.

Had we stored our self-generated value, every inbound reply would reference an id we
never recorded, and header matching would miss every time. Because SES owns the
`Message-ID` and it is only knowable *after* send, the hydration subsystem is
**required**, and the routing token remains worthwhile as a header-independent fallback.

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Replies still route correctly even when threading headers are absent/mangled or when a
  reply wins the race against Message-ID hydration.
- The token match is guarded (unique + participant-address check), so it cannot be used
  to hijack another participant's conversation.

**Negative / trade-offs**
- Reply-To addresses are opaque and per-conversation, which can look odd to humans and
  must not be treated as real mailboxes.
- The base receiving domain must support plus-addressing.
- It is extra machinery on top of header threading; it is intentionally a fallback, not
  the primary path.

**If Resend ever supports Message-ID passthrough**, revisit this: self-assigned
Message-IDs would let us drop both the token and the hydration logic. Until then, do not
attempt that simplification.
